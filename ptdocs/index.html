    <p>
	Thank you for taking your valuable time to look at my promotion and tenure documents. 

	This is a short summary of my achievements in research, teaching, and service. My full CV is <a href="cv-liangzk.pdf">here</a>. If you have suggestions or need more specific information, please email me. I greatly appreciate it. </p>
    <p><em><strong>Research Summary</strong></em>: I established the system security research group in NUS School of Computing, and advanced research in areas of web and browser security, software component isolation, software debugging and vulnerability diagnosis. I have been publishing my research results in top security and software engineering conferences and journals, such as IEEE Security and Privacy, ACM CCS, USENIX Security Symposium, NDSS, ESORICS, ACSAC, ACM FSE, ACM TISSEC, ACM TOSEM, and IEEE TDSC. My research has been supported by funding of over S$1.9 million (S$1.2 million as PI).  I have graduated three Ph.D. students and four research Master students. </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><em><strong>Teaching Summary</strong></em>: During the past five years, I created two new courses, CS4238 <em>Computer Security Practice</em> (Undergraduate) and CS5231 <em>Systems Security</em> (Graduate), and completely redeveloped the contents of the course CS3235 <em>Introduction to Computer Security</em> (Undergraduate). I have been practicing a teaching methodology of motivating students through practice. My courses and teaching method are recognized by students (4.5 out of 5 by student evaluation in recent semesters). I also helped to develop security contents in a few undergraduate courses. </dt>
      </dl>
    <p><em><strong>Service Summary</strong></em>: I have contributed to the research community as the TPC member of a number of conferences and workshops, including WWW 2011, NDSS 2013, NDSS 2014, WWW 2014. I have served as a member of the editorial board of the <em>International Journal of Security and Networks (IJSN)</em> since July 2011.  For university services, I currently serve as an assitant dean of NUS School of Computing, as well as a member of the Graduate Study Committee. I have been maintaining active connections with Singapore's government divisions, research labs, and companies related to cyber security. I am actively driving the effort to establish a platform in Singapore for academia, government, and companies to collaborate to facilitate research and education of cyber security. </p>
<h2>RESEARCH    </h2>
    <p><strong>My research aims at ensuring cyber environments free of malicious activities through principled schemes</strong>. A typical cyber environment consists of two parts, the <em>runtime platform</em> (e.g., the Windows Operating System, or the browser platform) and the <em>executables</em> (e.g., software programs, mobile Apps, or JavaScript libraries) running on top of the platform. My research drives security innovations in both parts of cyber environments, specifically, <em>designing new security primitives</em> for runtime platforms, and <em>developing new analysis methods</em> to prevent attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in executables. </p>
    <p>For new security primitives in runtime platforms, I have been investigating security primitives that guarantee the computation of executables is free of unexpected results. Specifically, my research in this direction focuses on the following aspects:  </p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>In a cyber environment, what is the uniqueness in its runtime platform and what are the appropriate primitives to eliminate unexpected results?  </li>
        <li>By reflecting on the experience in designing security primitives in one platform, what can we learn from them to improve security of other platforms?  </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>For new methods of analyzing executables, I aim to develop methods for accurate analysis, which can significantly improve the capability for attack response and prevention. Specifically, I advance my research in this area from the following perspectives: </p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>(<em>Diagnosis</em>) When an attack is detected, how to efficiently and accurately identify the key characteristics of the attack? </li>
        <li>(<em>Mitigation</em>) With the attack characteristics, how to promptly prevent ongoing attacks to minimize their impact? </li>
        <li>(<em>Prevention</em>) How to identify and fix software vulnerabilities through accurate analysis of programs?    </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

      <h2>TEACHING</h2>
    <p>For the past five years in NUS, I actively participated in building and restructuring the cyber security curriculum. In particular, I led the effort of creating and redesigning courses in system security. Before I joined the department, existing security courses focused on cryptography and network security. From 2008, I created or redeveloped a series of courses. Specifically, I have created two new courses, and redevelop the syllabus of another course. </p>
<p>I created a new undergraduate course, CS4238 <em>Computer Security Practice (<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~liangzk/cs4238/lecturesummary.html">Sample Syllabus</a>)</em>, to train the system security skills of senior undergraduate students, preparing them for a system security career. To support the instruction of this course, I designed the layout and networking of a new teaching lab, supporting 40 students (10 project groups). I also created a new course, CS5231 Systems Security. It focuses on system security knowledge and skills, as well as latest developments in system security research. </p>
<p>I also redeveloped the undergraduate course CS3235 (Introduction to Computer Security), shifting its focus from coding theory and cryptography to general computer security (including basic cryptography, software security, system security, network security, and web security).</p>
    <p>I have been practicing a new method of teaching security principles through practice.  I designed a series of live demos in class, showing students complex concepts like buffer overflow attacks and rootkit analysis. I also distribute virtual machines and external hard drives to students for them to study security tools. The method is effective in motivating students to see the connections between security knowledge and real-world problems. </p>
    <p>Here are sample results of my recent teaching feedback from students. </p>
