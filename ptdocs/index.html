    <p>
	Thank you for taking your valuable time to look at my promotion and tenure documents. 

	This is a short summary of my achievements in research, teaching, and service. My full CV is <a href="cv-liangzk.pdf">here</a>. If you have suggestions or need more specific information, please email me. I greatly appreciate it. </p>
    <p><em><strong>Research Summary</strong></em>: I established the system security research group in NUS School of Computing, and advanced research in areas of web and browser security, software component isolation, software debugging and vulnerability diagnosis. My research has been supported by funding of over S$1.9 million (S$1.2 million as PI). I have been publishing my research results in top security and software engineering conferences and journals, such as IEEE Security and Privacy, ACM CCS, USENIX Security Symposium, NDSS, ESORICS, ACSAC, ACM FSE, ACM TISSEC, ACM TOSEM, and IEEE TDSC.  I have graduated four research Master students and two Ph.D. students. Another Ph.D. student will defend his thesis in summer of 2013. </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><em><strong>Teaching Summary</strong></em>: During the past five years, I created a new course, CS4238 <em>Computer Security Practice</em> (Undergraduate), and completely redeveloped the contents of two security courses, CS3235 <em>Introduction to Computer Security</em> (Undergraduate) and CS5231 <em>Systems Security</em> (Graduate). I have been practicing a new teaching method of bringing system security practice in class instruction. My courses and teaching method are well received by students (4.5 out of 5 by student evaluation in recent semesters). I also helped to develop security contents in a few undergraduate courses. </dt>
      </dl>
    <p><em><strong>Service Summary</strong></em>: I have served as the TPC member of several conferences and workshops, including WWW 2011, NDSS 2013, NDSS 2014. I have served as a member of the editorial board of the <em>International Journal of Security and Networks (IJSN)</em> since July 2011. I have been the reviewer of a few major conference and journals, including ACM TISSEC, IEEE TDSC, etc. For university services, I have been a member of the Graduate Study (Admission) Committee of NUS School of Computing. I have been maintaining active connections with Singapore's government divisions, research labs, and companies related to cyber security. I am actively driving the effort to establish a platform in Singapore for academia, government, and companies to collaborate to facilitate research and education of cyber security. </p>
<h2>RESEARCH    </h2>
    <p>Execution environments are the center of computing platforms, such as traditional operating systems, web platforms, and mobile systems. My research has focused on securing execution environments through introducing new security primitives and developing new techniques for debugging and attack diagnosis. </p>
    <p>For new security primitives, I developed techniques to transparently isolate untrusted programs in Linux systems [5], and techniques to confine untrusted JavaScript in the browser environment [4]. From such experiences, I rethink the way binary components work in a program, and designed solutions to isolate untrusted program components to prevent backdoors [3] and unexpected side-effects in system and memory [2]. </p>
    <p>For debugging and attack diagnosis, I analyzed recent advanced memory-error exploits and created techniques to diagnose and classify them through a type system on binaries [7]. To efficiently discover software errors and debug such errors, I developed solutions to systematically detect errors [9] and debug errors [8] using symbolic execution on binaries. </p>

      <h2>TEACHING</h2>
    <p>I lead the effort of redesigning the system security curriculum in NUS. I created the undergraduate CS4238 <em>Computer Security Practice</em>, to train the system security skills of senior undergraduate students (<a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~liangzk/cs4238/lecturesummary.html">Sample Syllabus</a>). To support the instruction of this module, I designed the layout and networking of a new teaching lab, supporting 40 students (10 project groups).</p>
    <p>I also redeveloped the undergraduate course CS3235 (Introduction to Computer Security), shifting its focus from coding theory and cryptography to overall security (including basic cryptography, software security, system security, network security, and web security). I also redesigned the graduate course CS5231, from <em>Cryptographic techniques &amp; Data Security</em> to<em> Systems Security</em>.    </p>
    <p>I have been practicing a new method of teaching security principles through practice.  I designed a series of live demos in class, showing students complex concepts like buffer overflow attacks and rootkit analysis. I also distribute virtual machines and external hard drives to students for them to study security tools. The method is effective in motivating students to see security principles in detailed system knowledge. </p>
    <p>Here are sample results of my recent teaching feedback from students. </p>
